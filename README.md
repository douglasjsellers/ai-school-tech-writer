# AI for Developer Productivity: Technical Writer Agent
##Project Summary
The code base consists of functions that interact with an AI model to summarize pull requests and the entire code base. It includes a function to generate a human-readable summary of the code base in five to ten sentences. Additionally, there is a function to summarize the last five pull requests in three sentences each. The code also involves updating a README file with project and recent changes summaries. Furthermore, there is a utility file that imports modules for handling data formatting and interactions with external services. The code base focuses on automating the generation of human-readable summaries for code-related content and managing project documentation efficiently.
