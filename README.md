# AI for Developer Productivity: Technical Writer Agent
##Project Summary
The code base contains functions for summarizing pull requests and the entire code base itself. It utilizes OpenAI prompts to generate human-readable summaries of pull requests and the system as a whole. The main script orchestrates the process of updating a README file with project and recent changes summaries. Utility functions handle formatting data for OpenAI prompts and processing diffs and commit messages. The codebase integrates with external libraries for interacting with OpenAI and handling output parsing. Overall, the codebase focuses on automating the generation of clear and concise summaries for developer productivity and technical writing tasks.
